This is a prototype webvr puzzle to be used in the Effugium prototype V2. 

It was developed with Aframe.io using Atom and node live-server. It is being hosted by Github. 

To use:

-open a browser on your computer or mobile device and go to wasgunnabut.github.io
-In the browser, you can control the character using the arrow keys and the mouse. 
-To go into VR click the small VR icon in the lower right of the screen.
--If you are on a computer you will need a vive or occulus.
--If you are on mobile you will need a Google Cardboard.
-The app will automatically go into VR mode, put on your headset and enjoy.

As we continue to develop our prototype the VR puzzle will begin to look more like the physical room but with certain additions, giving the players hints as to the locations of hidden objects in physical room.
